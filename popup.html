<p>Name's Reggie, I'm here to make registering for classes ezpz. Here's the scoop home-slice, 
I'm able to do 3 things to make WebReg less of a brain hemorrhage inducing nightmare that it is...</p>



<pre>
1) I'm able to auto-check the boxes for when you try to search for a course, 
that way you want have to spend several hourse of your life in 3 second intervals doing so yourself. 
To set your preferences, hit up my boi Mike <span>in the options page (right click my icon and select options).
</span> 
Just make sure you dont get on his bad side.</li>

2) I generate a link for the professor(s) name(s) that lead to a google search 
for their reviews, dont mention it my guy(or girl, Reggie be considerate like that)</li>

3) I notify you of courses that conflict you current schedule. 
A conflicting course will have a red background, and the time interval that causes
the conflict will be highlighted red. "Gee Reggie you sure do use red a lot". 
Yea so what fight me idiot.</li>
</pre>


<p>In conclusion, WebReg is sometimes a pain, but with cha boi, we'll get through it a bit faster</p>
